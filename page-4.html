  <h1 class="new-h1">Quick Tips</h1>
  <h2>Lighting</h2>
    <p>Proper lighting is crucial for indoor plants. Different plants have varying light requirements, so it's 
      important to understand your plant's needs. Generally, place high-light plants closer to windows with ample 
      sunlight, while low-light plants can thrive in shady spots. Rotate your plants periodically to ensure even growth as they reach for the light.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Watering</h2>
    <p>Overwatering is a common pitfall. Be sure to water your plants appropriately, considering factors like plant 
      type, pot size, and environmental conditions. Allow the top inch of soil to dry before watering again. Using pots 
      with drainage holes can help prevent waterlogging. Remember, it's better to under water slightly than to drown your plants.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Humidity</h2>
    <p>Indoor environments can sometimes be dry, especially in heated or air-conditioned spaces. Some plants, such as tropical varieties, 
      thrive in higher humidity. You can increase humidity by misting your plants, placing them on trays filled with water and pebbles, or using a room humidifier.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Potting & Soil</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right potting mix is essential. Use well-draining soil appropriate for your plant type.
       Repot your plants when they outgrow their containers, providing them with fresh nutrients and space for growth.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Fertilizing</h2>
    <p>Indoor plants benefit from occasional fertilizing during their active growing seasons (usually spring and summer). 
      Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer and follow the instructions on the packaging. Avoid over-fertilizing, as this can harm the plant.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Pruning & Grooming</h2>
    <p>Regularly prune your plants to remove dead or yellowing leaves, encourage bushier growth, and maintain their overall shape. 
      Grooming also helps improve airflow around the plant, reducing the risk of pests and diseases.</p>
